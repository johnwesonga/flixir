# Authentication Configuration Changes

## Summary

The TMDB authentication system has been **enabled by default** in the runtime configuration. This change makes the authentication system immediately available without requiring manual configuration file edits.

## Changes Made

### `config/runtime.exs`
- **Enabled TMDB authentication configuration** by uncommenting the following lines:
  ```elixir
  api_key: System.get_env("TMDB_API_KEY"),
  base_url: System.get_env("TMDB_BASE_URL") || "https://api.themoviedb.org/3",
  ```

### Impact
- **Authentication is now active by default** when `TMDB_API_KEY` environment variable is set
- **No manual configuration required** - the system will automatically use environment variables
- **Backward compatible** - existing installations will continue to work
- **Production ready** - authentication system is now enabled for production deployments

## Required Action

To use the authentication system, you only need to set the required environment variable:

```bash
export TMDB_API_KEY="your_tmdb_api_key_here"
```

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation files have been updated to reflect these changes:

1. **README.md**:
   - Updated installation instructions to reflect enabled authentication
   - Clarified that authentication is now enabled by default
   - Updated environment variable documentation
   - Added emphasis on required TMDB_API_KEY

2. **AUTHENTICATION.md**:
   - Added configuration section showing the enabled runtime configuration
   - Updated environment variable documentation
   - Clarified that authentication is now active by default

3. **CLAUDE.md**:
   - Updated configuration structure documentation
   - Added note about enabled TMDB authentication

## Benefits

- **Simplified Setup**: New users can immediately use authentication without configuration file edits
- **Production Ready**: Authentication system is ready for production deployment
- **Environment-Based**: Configuration follows 12-factor app principles using environment variables
- **Secure by Default**: Authentication system is available but requires explicit API key configuration

## Migration

Existing installations will automatically benefit from this change. No migration steps are required - the authentication system will become active as soon as the `TMDB_API_KEY` environment variable is set.
