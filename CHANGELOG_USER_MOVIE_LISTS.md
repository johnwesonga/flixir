# User Movie Lists Feature - Router Updates

## Changes Made

### Router Updates (`lib/flixir_web/router.ex`)

Added two new protected routes to the `:authenticated` pipeline:

1. **Create New List Route**: `/my-lists/new`
   - Route: `live "/my-lists/new", UserMovieListsLive, :new`
   - Purpose: Dedicated page for creating new movie lists
   - Authentication: Required (uses `:authenticated` pipeline)

2. **Edit List Route**: `/my-lists/:id/edit`
   - Route: `live "/my-lists/:id/edit", UserMovieListLive, :edit`
   - Purpose: Dedicated page for editing existing list details
   - Authentication: Required (uses `:authenticated` pipeline)

### Complete User Movie Lists Routing Structure

The user movie lists feature now has the following routes:

```elixir
# Protected routes (authentication required)
scope "/", FlixirWeb do
  pipe_through :authenticated

  # User movie lists management
  live "/my-lists", UserMovieListsLive, :index          # Lists dashboard
  live "/my-lists/new", UserMovieListsLive, :new        # Create new list
  live "/my-lists/:id", UserMovieListLive, :show        # View individual list
  live "/my-lists/:id/edit", UserMovieListLive, :edit   # Edit list details
end
```

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Updated the "Application Routes" section to include the new routes
- Enhanced the "User Movie Lists Interface" section with detailed descriptions of each route
- Added router configuration information explaining the `:authenticated` pipeline

### Tasks Documentation
- Updated `.kiro/specs/user-movie-lists/tasks.md` to mark task 8 as completed
- Added specific route details to the routing task description

## Route Functionality

### `/my-lists/new` (Create New List)
- **LiveView**: `UserMovieListsLive` with `:new` action
- **Purpose**: Dedicated page for creating new movie lists
- **Features**:
  - Full-page form for list creation
  - Real-time validation with error feedback
  - Privacy controls (public/private)
  - Rich input fields for name and description
  - Cancel/Save actions with navigation

### `/my-lists/:id/edit` (Edit List)
- **LiveView**: `UserMovieListLive` with `:edit` action
- **Purpose**: Dedicated page for editing existing list details
- **Features**:
  - Pre-populated form fields with current list data
  - Real-time validation for changes
  - Privacy toggle between public and private
  - Save changes or cancel and return to list view
  - Proper authorization checks to ensure users can only edit their own lists

## Security Considerations

Both new routes are protected by the `:authenticated` pipeline, which:
- Requires valid TMDB authentication
- Automatically redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth/login`
- Preserves the intended destination for post-login redirect
- Ensures users can only access and modify their own lists

## Integration with Existing Features

The new routes integrate seamlessly with:
- **Authentication System**: Uses existing TMDB authentication and session management
- **Lists Context**: Leverages the `Flixir.Lists` context for data operations
- **UI Components**: Uses the comprehensive `UserMovieListComponents` library
- **Navigation**: Integrates with the main navigation and breadcrumb systems
- **Error Handling**: Follows established error handling and user feedback patterns

## Next Steps

With the routing infrastructure complete, the remaining tasks include:
- Enhancing movie details pages with "Add to List" functionality
- Creating comprehensive templates for the LiveViews
- Writing unit and integration tests for the new routes
- Adding component tests for the UI elements
- Creating end-to-end workflow tests

## Testing

The new routes should be tested for:
- Authentication requirements and redirect behavior
- Proper parameter validation and error handling
- User authorization (users can only access their own lists)
- Integration with the Lists context and database operations
- UI rendering and form validation
- Error states and recovery mechanisms
