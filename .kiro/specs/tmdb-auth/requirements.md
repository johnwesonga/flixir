# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements user authentication using The Movie Database (TMDB) API authentication system. Users will be able to log in and log out using their TMDB credentials, enabling personalized features like creating watchlists, rating movies, and accessing user-specific data from TMDB. The authentication will integrate with TMDB's session-based authentication flow, which involves requesting tokens, validating them with user credentials, and creating authenticated sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with my TMDB credentials, so that I can access personalized features and sync my data with TMDB.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the login button THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the TMDB authentication flow
2. WHEN a user provides valid TMDB credentials THEN the system SHALL create an authenticated session
3. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store their session information securely
5. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their intended destination or dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to see my authentication status in the application, so that I know I'm logged in and can access my account information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the system SHALL display their TMDB username in the navigation
2. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the system SHALL show a logout option in the user menu
3. WHEN a user is not logged in THEN the system SHALL show a login button
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically update the UI to reflect unauthenticated state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to log out of the application, so that I can securely end my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL invalidate their TMDB session
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all stored session data
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the home page
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL update the UI to show unauthenticated state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to log in every time I visit the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL store session information that persists browser restarts
2. WHEN a user returns to the application with a valid stored session THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate them
3. WHEN a stored session is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL clear it and show unauthenticated state
4. IF a user's TMDB session expires THEN the system SHALL handle the expiration gracefully and prompt for re-authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to handle TMDB API errors gracefully, so that users have a smooth experience even when external services have issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TMDB API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
2. WHEN TMDB API requests timeout THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN TMDB returns rate limiting errors THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately and inform the user
4. WHEN network errors occur during authentication THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication process to be secure, so that my TMDB credentials and session data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling user sessions THEN the system SHALL use secure, HTTP-only cookies
2. WHEN storing session data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive information
3. WHEN making TMDB API requests THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS exclusively
4. WHEN a user's session is compromised THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to invalidate all sessions
