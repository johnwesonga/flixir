# Code Quality Fix - Function Organization

## Overview

This update fixes a code organization issue in the `UserMovieListsLive` module where `handle_event/3` function clauses were not properly grouped together, causing Elixir compiler warnings.

## Changes Made

### Function Organization Fix

**File**: `lib/flixir_web/live/user_movie_lists_live.ex`

**Issue Resolved**: 
- Fixed Elixir compiler warning: "clauses with the same name and arity should be grouped together"
- Reorganized `handle_event/3` function clauses to be properly grouped

**Changes**:
- Moved scattered `handle_event/3` functions to be grouped together
- Specifically moved the following event handlers to be with other `handle_event/3` clauses:
  - `"retry_failed_operations"`
  - `"sync_with_tmdb"`
  - `"toggle_privacy"`

### Code Organization Benefits

1. **Compiler Compliance**: Eliminates Elixir compiler warnings about function clause organization
2. **Code Readability**: All event handlers are now grouped together for easier navigation
3. **Maintainability**: Follows Elixir best practices for function organization
4. **Developer Experience**: Cleaner compilation output without warnings

### Function Structure

The LiveView module now follows proper Elixir organization:

```elixir
defmodule FlixirWeb.UserMovieListsLive do
  # Module attributes and use statements
  
  # Lifecycle callbacks (mount, handle_params)
  @impl true
  def mount(...)
  
  @impl true  
  def handle_params(...)
  
  # All handle_event/3 clauses grouped together
  @impl true
  def handle_event("show_create_form", ...)
  
  @impl true
  def handle_event("create_list", ...)
  
  # ... all other handle_event/3 clauses
  
  # All handle_info/2 clauses grouped together
  @impl true
  def handle_info({:list_updated, ...}, ...)
  
  # ... other handle_info/2 clauses
  
  # Private helper functions
  defp load_user_lists(...)
  # ... other private functions
end
```

## Technical Details

### Elixir Function Organization Rules

Elixir requires that functions with the same name and arity be defined consecutively. This is because:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Elixir uses pattern matching to determine which function clause to execute
2. **Compilation Optimization**: The compiler can optimize pattern matching when clauses are grouped
3. **Code Clarity**: Grouped clauses make it easier to understand all possible patterns for a function

### Before Fix

Functions were scattered throughout the module:
- Some `handle_event/3` clauses were defined early in the module
- Other `handle_event/3` clauses were defined after `handle_info/2` functions
- This violated Elixir's function organization requirements

### After Fix

All `handle_event/3` clauses are now properly grouped together, following Elixir conventions and eliminating compiler warnings.

## Impact

- **Zero Breaking Changes**: This is purely a code organization improvement
- **Improved Code Quality**: Eliminates compiler warnings
- **Better Developer Experience**: Cleaner compilation output
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Follows Elixir best practices

- No template or test changes required

## Future Considerations

This fix establishes the proper pattern for organizing LiveView modules:

1. Always group functions with the same name/arity together
2. Follow the standard LiveView organization pattern (mount → handle_params → handle_event → handle_info → private functions)
3. Use consistent `@impl true` annotations for callback implementations
4. Maintain clear separation between public callbacks and private helper functions

## Verification

The fix can be verified by running:

```bash
# Check for compilation warnings
mix compile

# Run tests to ensure functionality is unchanged
mix test
```

The compilation should now complete without the function organization warning.
